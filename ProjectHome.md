_Marave doesn't just have minimalism and simplicity, it has minimalism and simplicity combined with beauty and a palpable design ethic. Marave has soul._

-- Linux Journal review of Marave.





# Intro #

Inspired by ommwriter and other similar projects, marave (it means "nothing" or "it doesn't matter" in guaraní) aims to be a simple, clean text editor that doesn't distract you from your writing.

  * Clean interface. Most of the time: NO interface

  * Pretty

  * Customizable

You can have a nice background, or just a color. You can have a realtime spellchecker or not. Syntax highlighting or not. You can have background music, keyboard feedback, or silence. Marave will try to be the way you want it to be.

# Latest Release #

The 0.7 beta release is out, please see if you like it.

# Getting Marave #

I hope Marave will eventually be packaged for most operating systems, but that's not yet the case:

  * In Arch Linux , get it from [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=34667)

  * In Fedora, get it from Rex Dieter's page: http://rdieter.fedorapeople.org/rpms/marave/

  * There is a package for Debian in process of being created, you can build it using stuff from [here](http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/m/marave/) if I understand correctly.

In other operating systems and Linux distributions, you need to work with the sources.

If you have PyQt installed, you may be able to install Marave using one of these commands:

easy\_install marave

or

pip install marave

If that doesn't work you can just get the sources from the link on the right side of this page and read the README file.
